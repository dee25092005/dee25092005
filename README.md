# Hi, I'm Dee (Phonepaseuth Phommathep) 

### 🛠️ Backend-Focused Developer
*From Pakse, Laos.*

I am an **App Development student at the National University of Laos (third year)**. I believe that a beautiful frontend is only as good as the logic supporting it. Currently, I am deep-diving into **Golang and MongoDB** to build high-performance systems, while bridging the gap between elegant design and robust backend architecture.
